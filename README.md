# Crop-disease-detection
: Crop diseases often go undetected until it's too late, causing major losses. Delayed identification of crop diseases is a major cause of agricultural loss, as pathogens often spread unnoticed until damage is irreversible. Farmers lack timely, expert tools for early detection, leading to reduced yields and increased costs.
